My name is Ania Grodsky, and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Mathematics. I am fortunate to work in Dr. [Galit Lahav's](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/galit-lahav) group in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. I have worked with Dr. Lahav since January 2025, and in the summer of 2023 as part of the Systems Biology REU. I have also worked with Dr. [Jordan Horowitz](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/horowitz-lab/) in the Biophysics REU at the University of Michigan, and Dr. [Kyle Miller](https://www.kyle-miller.org/SATlab.html) at Michigan State University.

I am interested in restoring effective decision-making to impaired signaling networks through systems and synthetic biology. Click on the [research interest](http://ania1661.github.io) tab for a more details!

I have training in both biological research, through my work in various labs. At MSU, I spent a year studying how
axons physically elongate, with most of my time focused on live-cell imaging of cytoskeletal proteins in growing neurons. I also have bench experience with plasmid work (minipreps, PCR) and immunofluorescence. This summer in the Lahav lab, I am continuing to expand my skills through tissue culture of cancer cell lines and additional molecular biology techniques. I am proficient in Python and MATLAB and have experience with commonly used image analysis platforms like Fiji and CellProfiler.

My coursework at Michigan State has mostly focused on applied mathematics with applications to biology, such as Dynamical Systems, Control Theory, Discrete Math and Graph Theory, Stochastic Processes and Real Analysis. I hope to encorperate both these aspects of my education to answer biological questions related to cell signaling and understanding DNA damage response.
