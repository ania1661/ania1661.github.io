My name is Ania Grodsky, and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Mathematics. I am fortunate to work in Dr. [Galit Lahav's](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/galit-lahav) group in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. I have worked with Dr. Lahav since January 2025, and in the summer of 2023 as part of the Systems Biology REU. I have also worked with Dr. [Jordan Horowitz](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/horowitz-lab/) in the Biophysics REU at the University of Michigan, and Dr. [Kyle Miller](https://www.kyle-miller.org/SATlab.html) at Michigan State University.

I am interested in restoring effective cellular decision-making in cells with disease-disrupted signaling pathways. My current focus is the DNA damage response (DDR), which is frequently compromised in cancer due to the loss of the key transcription factor p53. In particular, I am working on a project involving the reconstitution of p53 in p53-null cancer cells. While reintroducing p53 protein alone is straightforward, the original DDR network relies on a negative feedback loop (involving MDM2 and WIP1) that shapes p53’s dynamics and enables it to integrate information over time. My project aims to understand how to rebuild this feedback architecture in order to restore the cell’s full decision-making capacity. More broadly, I am interested exploring how cells might regain decision-making ability when p53 is absent by modifying the decision-making signaling circuits themselves. This includes four strategies: restoring the function of the p53 decision circuit, co-opting the decision-making machinery of alternate death pathways, enhancing the execution strength of existing non-p53 decision modules downstream of DDR signaling, and engineering entirely new synthetic circuits capable of translating upstream kinase activity into robust cell fate decisions.

I have training in both biological research, through my work in various labs, as well as mathematical research. My coursework at Michigan State has mostly focused on applied mathematics with applications to biology, such as Dynamical Systems, Control Theory, Discrete Math and Graph Theory, Stochastic Processes and Real Analysis. I hope to encorperate both these aspects of my education to answer biological questions related to cell signaling and understanding DNA damage response.
