My name is Ania Grodsky, and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Mathematics. I am fortunate to work in Dr. [Galit Lahav's](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/galit-lahav) group in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. I have worked with Dr. Lahav since January 2025, and in the summer of 2023 as part of the Systems Biology REU. I have also worked with Dr. [Jordan Horowitz](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/horowitz-lab/) in the Biophysics REU at the University of Michigan, and Dr. [Kyle Miller](https://www.kyle-miller.org/SATlab.html) at Michigan State University.

I have training in both biological research, through my work in various labs, as well as mathematical research. My coursework at Michigan State has mostly focused on applied mathematics with applications to biology, such as Dynamical Systems, Control Theory, Discrete Math and Graph Theory, Stochastic Processes and Real Analysis. I hope to encorperate both these aspects of my education to answer biological questions related to cell signaling and understanding DNA damage response.
