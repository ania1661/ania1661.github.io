I am interested in restoring effective cellular decision-making in cells with disease-disrupted signaling pathways. My current focus is the DNA damage response (DDR), which is frequently compromised in cancer due to the loss of the key transcription factor p53. In particular, I am working on a project involving the reconstitution of p53 in p53-null cancer cells. While reintroducing p53 protein alone is straightforward, the original DDR network relies on a negative feedback loop (involving MDM2 and WIP1) that shapes p53’s dynamics and enables it to integrate information over time. My project aims to understand how to rebuild this feedback architecture in order to restore the cell’s full decision-making capacity. More broadly, I am interested exploring how cells might regain decision-making ability when p53 is absent by modifying the decision-making signaling circuits themselves. This includes four strategies: restoring the function of the p53 decision circuit, co-opting the decision-making machinery of alternate death pathways, enhancing the execution strength of existing non-p53 decision modules downstream of DDR signaling, and engineering entirely new synthetic circuits capable of translating upstream kinase activity into robust cell fate decisions.
